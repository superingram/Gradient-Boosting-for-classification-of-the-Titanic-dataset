# Gradient-Boosting-for-classification-of-the-Titanic-dataset
This project provides a description of gradient boosting with regard to linear regression and decision trees and how the nth decision tree prediction is dependent on the prediction before it.  A graphical representation of this principle is also depicted.  Then, a gradient boosting classifier is developed for the Titanic dataset where several learning rates are tuned to predict survival.  A confusion matrix and classification report are produced and the ROC area under the curve is calculated.
